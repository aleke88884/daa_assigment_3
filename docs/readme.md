| Metric | Prim's Algorithm | Kruskal's Algorithm | Winner |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Total Execution Time** | 620.05 ms | 814.92 ms | **Prim 1.31x faster** |

## 2. Comparative Analysis: Theory vs. Practice

### 2.1 Theoretical Time Complexity

#### Prim's Algorithm (Binary Heap Implementation)

| Operation | Frequency | Cost per Operation | Total Complexity |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Initialize | Once | O(V) | O(V) |
| Extract-Min | V times | O(log V) | O(V log V) |
| Decrease-Key | E times | O(log V) | O(E log V) |
| **Overall** | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | **O((V + E) log V)** |

**With Fibonacci Heap:** O(E + V log V) - theoretically optimal

#### Kruskal's Algorithm (Union-Find Implementation)

| Operation | Frequency | Cost per Operation | Total Complexity |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Sort Edges | Once | O(E log E) | O(E log E) |
| Union-Find Init | Once | O(V) | O(V) |
| Find + Union | E times | O(Œ±(V)) ‚âà O(1) | O(E ¬∑ Œ±(V)) |
| **Overall** | ‚Äî | ‚Äî | **O(E log E)** |

**Note:** Since E ‚â§ V¬≤ in connected graphs, log E ‚â§ 2 log V, making both algorithms **theoretically O(E log V)**.

### 2.2 Theoretical Space Complexity

| Algorithm | Data Structures | Space Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Prim's** | Priority Queue + Key Array + Parent Array + MST Set | **O(V + E)** |
| **Kruskal's** | Edge List + Union-Find (parent + rank arrays) | **O(V + E)** |

Both algorithms have **comparable space requirements**.

### 2.3 Practical Performance Analysis

Despite identical theoretical complexity, our empirical results show **significant practical differences**:

#### Performance by Graph Size Category

```
Small Graphs (5-30 vertices):
  Prim:    0.185 ms average
  Kruskal: 0.538 ms average
  Winner:  Prim (2.91x faster)
  Reason:  Lower initialization overhead

Medium Graphs (50-500 vertices):
  Prim:    2.47 ms average
  Kruskal: 3.48 ms average
  Winner:  Prim (1.41x faster)
  Reason:  Efficient priority queue operations

Large Graphs (600-3,000 vertices):
  Prim:    53.16 ms average
  Kruskal: 69.24 ms average
  Winner:  Prim (1.30x faster)
  Reason:  Better cache locality, optimized heap
```

#### Why Prim Outperforms in This Implementation

**1. Optimized Priority Queue Operations:**
- Java's `PriorityQueue` is highly optimized with efficient heap operations
- Extract-Min and insertion are cache-friendly operations
- Modern JVM optimizations benefit heap-based algorithms

**2. Lower Operation Count:**
- Prim performs 15.3x fewer operations overall
- Fewer comparisons needed per edge
- More direct path to MST construction

**3. Graph Representation:**
- Adjacency list representation favors Prim's vertex-centric approach
- Direct access to adjacent edges without sorting overhead
- Better memory access patterns for dense graphs

**4. Implementation Quality:**
- Duplicate node handling in priority queue is efficient
- Early termination when vertex already processed
- Minimal object creation overhead

#### Why Kruskal Has Higher Overhead

**1. Edge Sorting Dominates Small/Medium Graphs:**
- O(E log E) sorting cost is significant when E is large
- Java's sorting has constant factor overhead
- Sorting all 899,700 edges (Graph 30) takes considerable time

**2. Higher Operation Count:**
- Union-Find requires more operations despite O(Œ±(V)) amortized cost
- Path compression adds overhead for small trees
- Rank-based union requires extra comparisons

**3. Memory Access Patterns:**
- Processing edges in sorted order may have worse cache locality
- Random access to parent arrays in Union-Find
- More pointer chasing in disjoint set structure

### 2.4 Density Analysis

**Performance vs. Graph Density:**

| Density Range | Avg Prim (ms) | Avg Kruskal (ms) | Prim Advantage | Sample Size |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Sparse (0.10-0.15)** | 45.37 | 54.81 | 1.21x | 6 graphs |
| **Low (0.18-0.25)** | 25.32 | 35.13 | 1.39x | 12 graphs |
| **Medium (0.30-0.40)** | 9.72 | 14.33 | 1.47x | 9 graphs |
| **Dense (0.49-0.60)** | 0.12 | 0.52 | 4.33x | 3 graphs |

**Conclusion:** Prim's advantage **increases** with graph density, contrary to common assumptions that Kruskal performs better on sparse graphs.
